#' Converts BRIEF raw scores into T scores
#'
#' Takes in data with BRIEF raw scores in it and converts them into BRIEF T-scores.
#' Make sure that subscales are named "BRIEF_(subscale)_Pre". Currently supports
#' the 9 clinical subscales (Inhibit, shift, working memory etc) and GEC. No
#' support yet for MI, BRI or other subscales. Designed for multiply-imputed data
#'
#' @param data dataframe (for Tim's project: a mild object), contains columns
#' with BRIEF raw scores for each of the 9 subscales and GEC
